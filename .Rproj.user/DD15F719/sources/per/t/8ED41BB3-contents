# Descriptive analysis

## Data exploration and aggregation

From the background section, the main goal is to explore how academic
performance is affected by class type in 1st grade. To simplify the
model and eliminate the effect on the individual since they are likely
to be affected by massive unknown factors, analyzing the aggregated data
per class should be a good strategy. Thus, identifying different classes
and providing them with a unique id is necessary. To do so, there is a
new column called "teacherid" defined as the combination of the
teacher's experience, ethnicity, school id, and class type in 1st grade.

The 1st-grade student's math grade is a good measurement to examine
academic performance. In addition, since there are too many school ids,
including school-type fields may provide a better view while plotting.

As a result, the relevant fields are "math1", "experience1",
"tethnicity1", "school1", "schoolid1", and "star1".

```{r,warning=FALSE}
# Select all samples relevant to 1st grade
STAR<-STAR[!is.na(STAR$star1),]

# Select all fields relevant to 1st grade students' math grades
STAR<-STAR[,c("math1","experience1","tethnicity1","school1","schoolid1","star1")]
STAR$tethnicity1<-as.factor(STAR$tethnicity1)
STAR$schoolid1<-as.factor(STAR$schoolid1)
STAR$star1<-as.factor(STAR$star1)
STAR$school1<-as.factor(STAR$school1)

# Create a new field called "teacherid" for different classes
STAR$teacherid<-paste(STAR$experience1,STAR$tethnicity1,STAR$schoolid1,STAR$star1)
STAR$teacherid<-as.factor(STAR$teacherid)

# Provide basic information for each field with teacher as one unit
STAR.class.level<-STAR %>%
  group_by(experience1,tethnicity1,schoolid1,school1,star1,teacherid) %>%
  summarise(math.mean=mean(math1,na.rm = TRUE),
            math.median=median(math1,na.rm = TRUE))
summary(STAR.class.level)

# Provide statistic for their math grades based with teacher as one unit
print(STAR.class.level)
```

</details>

</p>

From the summary statistics, the majority of teachers are Caucasians.
Most schools come from rural areas, and the school with id 51 provides
the most data. The numbers of class types are approximately equal, so
the star1 data is nearly balanced. It is also noticeable that the mean
and median of the experience years are 11.74 and 11, but the maximum of
it reaches 42 years. This data point is a potential outlier if the
project focuses on researching the relation with experience years for
each teacher. The mean of students' average and median math grades per
class are around 530.

In the new aggregated data, there are still many missing values. To
avoid the effect of them, in this project, these missing values will be
omitted.

## Average Math Score versus Class Type

<details>

<summary>**Click to expand/collapse the code**</summary>

```{r,fig.height=8,fig.width=12}
# Box-plot and violin plot for math grade v.s. class type
ggplot(STAR.class.level,aes(x=star1,y=math.mean))+geom_boxplot()+
  labs(x="",y="Average Math Grade")+
  stat_summary(fun="mean")
  
ggplot(STAR.class.level,aes(x=star1,y=math.mean))+geom_violin()+
  labs(x="",y="Average Math Grade")
```

</details>

</p>

In the box plot, the small class has the best performance since its
mean, median, upper, and lower quantiles are the highest. Comparing
between regular and aide classes, they have an approximately equal
median, but the box of aide class is larger than regular. These results
state that students in aide classes tend to be less stable than in
regular.

In the violin plot, the small and regular classes have a nearly
symmetric shape, but the aide class has more portions at the bottom.
Therefore, the majority of classes in the aide type have mean math
scores smaller than the average, while regular and small classes have a
close mean and median.

In conclusion, class type shows a linear association with the class's
average math score.

## Average Math Score versus school Type

<details>

<summary>**Click to expand/collapse the code**</summary>

```{r,fig.height=8,fig.width=12}
# Box-plot and violin plot for math grade v.s. school type
ggplot(STAR.class.level,aes(x=school1,y=math.mean))+geom_boxplot()+
  labs(x="",y="Mean Math Grade")

ggplot(STAR.class.level,aes(x=school1,y=math.mean))+geom_violin()+
  labs(x="",y="Average Math Grade")
```

</details>

</p>

Since there are too many schools, and their ids are randomly assigned,
the project uses the field of school type to provide more direct plots
and valuable information.

From the box plot, the urban school has the best performance in average
math grade per class, and the inner city has the worst. The box of rural
schools is the smallest, so students here should have the most stable
math grade.

From the violin plot, the urban and inner-city schools tend to have more
portions of classes having average math scores lower than the average,
while the average math grades of classes in suburban and rural schools
are symmetrically distributed. Also, the classes in rural schools have
more classes earning average math grades per class close to the mean.

In conclusion, school type shows a linear association with the class's
average math score.

# Inferential analysis

## Two-Way Anova Model

We can define a two-way ANOVA model as follows $$
Y_{ijk} = \mu_{..} + \alpha_{i} + \beta_{j} + \epsilon_{ijk}
$$ , where the index $i={1,2,3}$ represents the class type: small
($i=1$), regular ($i=2$), regular with aide ($i=3$), and the index
$j={1,...,80}$ represents the school indicator. In the model,
$\mu_{..}=\frac{1}{240}\sum_{i=1}^3\sum_{j=1}^{80}\mu_{ij}$, $\alpha_i$
represents the coefficient for the ith type of class, and the $\beta_j$
is the coefficient of jth school. The constraints are
$\sum_{i=1}^3\alpha_i=0$ and $\sum_{i=1}^{80}\beta_j$. In this model, we
assumed that the observations are independent and normally distributed
with approximately equal variance. The reason that we choose to discard
the interaction term is that the school id is the control variable.

<details>

<summary>**Click to expand/collapse the code**</summary>

```{r}
anova.fit<-aov(math.mean~star1+schoolid1,data = STAR.class.level)
anova.fit2<-aov(math.mean~star1+school1,data = STAR.class.level)
print(anova.fit2$coefficients)
```

</details>

</p>

Since there are too many schools and school ids cannot provide direct
information to our analysis. Thus, the school type is applied in the
model temporarily. From the result above, small classes tend to have a
higher average math grade. Classes in rural and urban schools tend to
have a better performance on the average math grade per class.

## Hypothesis Test

<details>

<summary>**Click to expand/collapse the code**</summary>

```{r}
summary(anova.fit)
```

</details>

</p>

1.  $H_0$:$\alpha_i=0~\forall i$ $H_a$:Not all $\alpha_i$'s are 0.

2.  $H_0$:$\beta_j=0~\forall j$ $H_a$:Not all $\beta_j$'s are 0

The significance level is 0.05. From the summary statistic of the
two-way ANOVA model, the p-values for different class types are all
smaller than 0.05. Thus, those 2 null hypotheses are rejected, and
different class types and schools influence the average math grade per
class.

## Tukey's Range Test

<details>

<summary>**Click to expand/collapse the code**</summary>

```{r,fig.width=10}
sig.level<-0.05
T.ci<-TukeyHSD(anova.fit,conf.level = 1-sig.level)
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(T.ci, las=1 , col="red")
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
print(T.ci[["star1"]]["regular+aide-small",])
```

</details>

</p>

The significance level is 0.05. The secondary question is whether the
highest average math grade exists among different classes. To figure
this question out, if the difference between the top 2 types of class is
larger than 0 at $\alpha=0.05$, this result should be certain at
$(1-\alpha)$%. Thus, after defining $s=\mu_{small}-\mu_{regular+aide}$,
and we have a hypothesis test: $$
H_0:s>0 \\
H_a:s<=0
$$ Since the 95% confidence interval does not contain 0, the null
hypothesis is kept, and the average math grade for a small class is the
highest with 95% certainty.

# Sensitivity analysis

## Model Diagnostic

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(anova.fit,which = 1)
qqnorm(residuals(anova.fit))
qqline(residuals(anova.fit),col = "red")
```

</details>

</p>

Since the dots are dotted approximately uniformly distributed at the 2
sides of y=0, the assumption of equal variance should hold true. In the
Q-Q plot, the line is heavy-tailed, so the normality assumption is
violated.

<details>

<summary>**Click to expand/collapse the code**</summary>

```{r}
vars<-tapply(STAR.class.level$math.mean,STAR.class.level$star1,var) # Find sample variances for each occupation
alpha<-0.05 # Significance level

# Hartley test
H.stat<-max(vars)/min(vars)
ns<-as.numeric(table(STAR.class.level$star1))
H<-qmaxFratio(1-alpha,df=sum(ns)/length(ns),k=3)
print(paste0(c(H.stat,H)))
```

</details>

</p>

By doing Hartley's Test, since $H^*<H(1-\alpha;n-1,r)$, the variances
are likely to equal among different classes.

<details>

<summary>**Click to expand/collapse the code**</summary>

```{r}
# Shapiro-Wilk test for normality
shapiro.test(anova.fit$residuals)
```

</details>

</p>

Since the p-value or Shapiro-Wilk normality test is smaller than 0.05,
the significance level. The null hypothesis that the residuals are
normally distributed is rejected.

## Median Aggregatiion Method

Since the normality assumption is violated while using mean to
aggregate, we want to try median as the new aggregation method to keep
the normality.

```{r}
anova.fit<-aov(math.median~star1+schoolid1,data = STAR.class.level)
anova.fit2<-aov(math.median~star1+school1,data = STAR.class.level)
print(anova.fit2$coefficients)
```

</details>

</p>

Similar to the mean method, since there are too many schools and school
ids cannot provide direct information to our analysis. Thus, the school
type is applied in the model temporarily. From the result above, small
classes tend to have a higher median math grade. Classes in rural and
urban schools tend to have a better performance on the median math grade
per class.

2.  $H_0$:$\beta_j=0~\forall j$ $H_a$:Not all $\beta_j$'s are 0

The significance level is 0.05. From the summary statistic of the
two-way ANOVA model, the p-values for different class types are all
smaller than 0.05. Thus, those 2 null hypotheses are rejected, and
different class types and schools influence the median math grade per
class.

Since the dots are dotted approximately uniformly distributed at the 2
sides of y=0, the assumption of equal variance should hold. In the Q-Q
plot, the line is heavy-tailed, so the normality assumption may be
violated.

<details>

ns<-as.numeric(table(STAR.class.level$star1))

By doing Hartley's Test, since $H^*<H(1-\alpha;n-1,r)$, the variances
are likely to equal among different classes.

<details>

<summary>**Click to expand/collapse the code**</summary>

```{r}
# Shapiro-Wilk test for normality
shapiro.test(anova.fit$residuals)
```

</details>

</p>

Since the p-value or Shapiro-Wilk normality test is smaller than 0.05,
the significance level. The null hypothesis that the residuals are
normally distributed is rejected.

In conclusion, replacing mean with median math grade per class seems to
provide little help in solving the normality problem.
